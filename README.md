# Tesla-Stock-Prediction
I developed a stock price prediction project using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques. The project involved analyzing and processing time series data for stock prices using libraries like pandas and numpy, and building an LSTM model using Keras to forecast future stock prices. I segmented the data into training and testing sets, utilizing training techniques such as early stopping to enhance model performance. The prediction phase was carried out using the trained model, and its performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. This project showcases my ability to analyze data, construct and train machine learning models for future data prediction, and provide tangible results using real-world data."
